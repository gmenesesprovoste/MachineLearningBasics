# MachineLearningBasics
A review of the basics of Machine Learning through programming tasks in OCTAVE.

These OCTAVE scripts correspond to my solutions to all the assignments in the "Machine Learning" course taught by Professor Andrew Ng from Stanford University and DeepLearning.AI (via Coursera). 
In order to increase efficiency in each function, I have mainly used vectorised implementations. 

This course was replaced in June 2022 by a new Python-based version.
